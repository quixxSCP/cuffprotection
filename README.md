# CuffProtection Plugin for SCP: Secret Laboratory

---

## CuffProtection v1.4.0

Ever get frustrated when you successfully cuff a D-Boi, only for a trigger-happy guard to come along and steal your kill? Or maybe you've been the one cuffed, helplessly watching as someone other than your captor decides your fate.

**CuffProtection** is here to change that! This plugin introduces a simple yet game-changing mechanic: once a player is cuffed, they are protected from being harmed by anyone *except* for the person who cuffed them.

### Features

*   **üõ°Ô∏è Cuffed Player Protection:** Cuffed players cannot be damaged by any player other than their original cuffer. This prevents kill-stealing and encourages more strategic gameplay.
*   **ü§ù The Cuffer is King:** The player who applies the handcuffs is the only one (besides SCPs) who can harm the cuffed individual. This gives the cuffer full control over their detainee.
*   **üîî Smart Notifications:** Stay informed! The plugin provides customizable on-screen hints to both the original cuffer and the cuffed player if someone else removes the cuffs.
    *   The **original cuffer** is alerted when someone else frees their captive.
    *   The **cuffed player** is notified who set them free.
*   **CLEANUP:** The plugin automatically handles clearing its data on player death and at the end of each round to ensure smooth performance.

### How It Works

1.  **Handcuffing:** When a player cuffs another, the plugin logs who cuffed whom.
2.  **Protection Activated:** The cuffed player is now immune to damage from all players...
3.  **Exception to the Rule:** ...*except* for the player who initially cuffed them. SCPs can still harm cuffed players as usual.
4.  **Removing Cuffs:**
    *   If the original cuffer removes the cuffs, everything proceeds as normal.
    *   If a *different* player removes the cuffs, optional notifications are sent out.
5.  **Reset:** The protection is removed if the cuffed player dies, is uncuffed, or the round ends.
